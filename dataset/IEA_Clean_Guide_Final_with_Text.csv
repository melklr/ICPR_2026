Li-ion is already a fairly mature technology and is undergoing rapid cost decreases. Current (2023) sales-weighted average cost is around USD 150/kWh at pack level. The best energy density of this technology is generally around 200-250 Wh/kg at the cell level, but the combination of high nickel cathodes, cell-to-pack arrangements and silicon in the anode may bring energy density up over 300 Wh/kg. For LFP, the current best energy density at cell level is around 130-180 Wh/kg. The energy density difference between NMC and LFP can be however partly overcome thanks to better LFP cells arrangement at the battery pack level (e.g. cell-to-pack). Interest in LFP chemistries came back strongly during 2022 thanks to increased energy density at the battery pack level combined with lower cost and lower reliance on critical minerals. Battery re-use (e.g. second-life applications, for instance for energy storage) and/or recycling technologies and policies will be essential to ensure that batteries contribute to sustainability goals. Li-ion batteries are the dominant battery technology in the automotive sector today, but will likely be complemented and substituted by newer technologies from 2030 onwards (without the ""next-generation"", more energy-dense technologies covered elsewhere in this guide, prospects for significant battery cost decline and large-scale BEV adoption may be reduced and hence electrification will proceed less rapidly)."

The benefit of adding hydrogen is a more efficient use of the carbon in biomass, as the carbon in CO2 is converted into hydrocarbon fuels rather than being either vented (bio-FT route) or captured and stored (bio-FT w/ CCS route). Rather than providing negative emissions, the additionally converted carbon can displace fossil carbon within the energy system. Technical challenges revolve around tar buildup and removal during gasification. Bio-FT kerosene (biojet) is a American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM)-certified sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), allowed to be blended up to 50%. While bio-FT without hydrogen is still a valuable biofuel for net zero, adding hydrogen would allow for a more efficient use of biogenic carbon within the biomass (though it would prevent carbon capture and storage (CCS) from providing negative emissions). However, the source of hydrogen must be low-emission."

These gas turbines using hydrogen-rich mixtures have accumulated millions of hours of operation at large scale, whereas in the case of using pure hydrogen, they have reached a few thousands of operating hours at precommercial scale. There are technical challenges associated with the high combustion temperature of hydrogen (NOx emissions, reliability/flame instabilities/flashback). For these reasons, the combustor of the gas turbine needs to be modified for gases with high hydrogen contents. Burning (undiluted) fuel gas mixtures with hydrogen concentrations of 5-60% is possible in certain gas turbines, depending on the degree to which they have been modified. Burning (diluted) fuel gas mixtures containing hydrogen up to concentrations of 100% is possible in certain gas turbines with the addition of significant amounts of diluents such as N2/steam to the fuel gas. Commercial operation of F-class gas turbines with mixtures of up to 20% of hydrogen in natural gas mixture without hardware modifications is expected by 2025. In the case of H-class gas turbines, commercial operation with mixtures containing over 50% of hydrogen is expected in new combined cycle by 2027.

Molten salts are inorganic chemical compounds, typically a mixture of nitrate/nitrite salts (e.g. a mixture of potassium and sodium nitrate), which have high boiling points, low viscosity, low vapour pressure and high volumetric heat capacities, i.e. they require a relatively small storage tank. When selecting the chemical mixture, it is advantageous to have the lowest possible melting point and the highest possible boiling point to maximise the available temperature range for the molten salt. Salts that would normally be solid at ambient temperatures are maintained at temperatures above their melting points so that they are always in liquid, i.e. molten, form and can be heated to around 560°C. The efficiency of the system is maximised at higher temperatures, but the maximum operating temperature is limited by various factors such as corrosion, salt decomposition and salt vapour pressure. Molten salt storage is often associated with concentrated solar power (CSP) plants. The first large-scale implementation of this technology was the Andasol 1 CSP plant in Spain, which became operational in 2008. This was soon followed by Andasol 2 and Andasol 3 in 2009 and 2011 respectively.

Salts that would normally be solid at ambient temperatures are maintained at temperatures above their melting points so that they are always in liquid, i.e. molten, form and can be heated to around 560°C. The efficiency of the system is maximised at higher temperatures, but the maximum operating temperature is limited by various factors such as corrosion, salt decomposition and salt vapour pressure. Molten salt storage is often associated with concentrated solar power (CSP) plants. The first large-scale implementation of this technology was the Andasol 1 CSP plant in Spain, which became operational in 2008. This was soon followed by Andasol 2 and Andasol 3 in 2009 and 2011 respectively. The storage system uses a mixture of 60% sodium nitrate and 40% potassium nitrate as the storage medium, and the three plants have a storage capacity of 1 010 MWh and 120 MW. Molten salts can also be used as stand-alone bulk thermal storage, known as Carnot batteries, where electricity is used to generate heat via a heat pump, which is stored in the molten salt and then connected to a turbine, which may be an existing one in a fossil fuel power station. Further research is aimed at reducing overall costs, in particular improving efficiency by increasing the operating temperature range of the molten salt. A higher integration of variable renewable energy will increase the need of flexibility and energy storage. While Li-ion batteries have been largely deployed, issues around costs and a more limited lithium availability, call for alternative technologies. In addition, sometimes excess heat may be available."

",,Renewables,"Scotland, Germany",https://www.iea.org/reports/integrating-solar-and-wind,8.0,"Grid-forming inverters are a technology that, essentially, can create and maintain a constant voltage and contribute significantly to controlling frequency in a power grid. This is opposed to grid-following inverters, which need a strong reference signal from the grid to stay synchronised correctly. Grid-forming capabilities in an inverter are mainly enabled by using a different control scheme, although some hardware changes such as having an energy buffer (for example, a storage system or a capacitor) may be needed to sustain grid-forming capabilities beyond a fraction of a second. Grid-forming inverters can contribute to power system stability and be a key enabler of systems with high penetration of wind and solar PV, as they can provide essential system services that have been traditionally provided by synchronous machines, such as inertia or black start capabilities. Specifically, grid-forming capabilities based on wind and solar PV plants stand at a lower technological readiness than those using battery energy storage systems, because of their lack of storage capability. This prevents wind and solar PV plants from providing services such as virtual inertia in a symmetrical manner, as without a significant energy buffer they would be mostly limited to reducing their output.

Flexible operation of heat pumps,"Demand,Buildings,Systems integration in buildings,Demand response,Heat pump,Flexible operation of heat pumps",,,7,7,8.0,"Heat pumps offer significant potential for thermal storage and flexibility. By heating water at strategic times throughout the day, they can help reduce peak electricity demand, particularly during evening peaks, and shift consumption to periods of lower demand, such as nighttime or midday. This flexibility also supports the integration of surplus variable renewable energy into the grid. However, a key barrier to the widespread adoption of flexible heat pumps in many markets is the absence of clear price signals and the IT systems needed to relay these signals to the appliances.","Heating and cooling account for a significant portion of global electricity consumption.
